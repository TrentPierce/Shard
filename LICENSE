5. MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This License is governed by the laws of the State of Alabama.

================================================================================
WHY THIS WORKS FOR SHARD:

• Prevents Cloning: Competitors cannot fork "Shard Core" and launch 
  "MegaCorp AI Grid" because offering it "as a service" violates Clause 2(a).

• Allows Innovation: Researchers can still read your verification code to trust 
  it, which is vital for a crypto-economic system.

• Protects Revenue: The 10,000 inference request/month limit prevents 
  commercial use without a license while allowing small projects and 
  personal use.
